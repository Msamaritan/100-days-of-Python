# 100-days-of-Python

## Day 1 - Band Name Generator
In this project(Task), I have created a band name generator with a very naive method, that user should input their place of growth and their pet name. 
We concatenate both the strings and present that as their Band Name.

## Day 2 - Tip Calculator
The Tip Calculator will take inputs such as the Bill amount, Percentage of tip you want to give and the number of persons you want to split the bill with. 
It will give us the output for each person to pay the bill with two decimals of accuracy.
